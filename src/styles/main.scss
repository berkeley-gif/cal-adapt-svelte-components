// main.scss: Global Sass styles.
//
// These styles mostly follow those from the caladapt-website-2021 repo.
// An attempt has been made to include only the bare-minimum global styles that
// likely affect how a component will render. All other global styles, (for
// example those specific to pages, dashboards, etc.) have been excluded.
//
// This Sass setup also uses the newer Dart Sass while Cal-Adapt.org uses its
// predecessor node-sass, so some structure of the modules here may be different
// (for example the use of @use instead of @import in places).
